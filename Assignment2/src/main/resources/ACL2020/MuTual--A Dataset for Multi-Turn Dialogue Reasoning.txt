Abstract
Non-task oriented dialogue systems have
achieved great success in recent years due to
largely accessible conversation data and the de-
velopment of deep learning techniques. Given
a context, current systems are able to yield a
relevant and fluent response, but sometimes
make logical mistakes because of weak rea-
soning capabilities. To facilitate the conver-
sation reasoning research, we introduce Mu-
Tual, a novel dataset for Multi-Turn dialogue
Reasoning, consisting of 8,860 manually anno-
tated dialogues based on Chinese student En-
glish listening comprehension exams. Com-
pared to previous benchmarks for non-task ori-
ented dialogue systems, MuTual is much more
challenging since it requires a model that can
handle various reasoning problems. Empiri-
cal results show that state-of-the-art methods
only reach 71%, which is far behind the hu-
man performance of 94%, indicating that there
is ample room for improving reasoning abil-
ity. MuTual is available at https://github.
com/Nealcly/MuTual.
1 Introduction
Building an intelligent conversational agent is one
of the longest running goals in AI. Existing con-
versational agents can be categorized into task-
oriented dialogue systems (Kannan et al., 2016)
and non-task-oriented chatbot systems (Shum et al.,
2018; Wu et al., 2019). Owing to the rise of deep
learning techniques and the large amount of conver-
sation data for training (Lowe et al., 2015; Wu et al.,
2017; Zhang et al., 2018b), we are now witnessing
promising results of chatbots both in academia and
industry (Pan et al., 2019; Tao et al., 2019).
Neural dialogue systems are trained over a large
dialogue corpus and used to predict responses given
a context. There are two lines of methods. Retrieve-
based methods and generation based methods rely

on matching scores and perplexity scores, respec-
tively. Due to the development of text matching
and pre-training models (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu
et al., 2019), a machine is able to achieve highly
competitive results on these datasets, even close
to human performance. For instance, ESIM (Chen
et al., 2017) achieves 88% on the Dialogue NLI
(Welleck et al., 2019), and BERT achieves 85.8%,
93.1% and 98.5% in terms of R10@1, R10@2 and
R10@5 on the Ubuntu Corpus (Whang et al., 2019).
However, there is still a huge gap between high
performance on the leader-board and poor practi-
cal user experience. Chatbot engines often gener-
ate responses that are logically incorrect or violate
commonsense knowledge (Shum et al., 2018). A
likely reason is that current dialogue systems do
not have strong reasoning skills, and most of the
cases in previous benchmarks can be tackled by lin-
guistic information matching. Previous work has
demonstrated that neural encoders capture a rich
hierarchy of syntactic and semantic information
(Jawahar et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2019). However,
reasoning capability and commonsense knowledge
are not captured sufficiently (Young et al., 2018).
One important research question is how we can
evaluate reasoning ability in chatbots, which can
potentially allow us to bridge the gap between high
performance on leader-board and unsatisfactory
practical performance. To this end, we develop

an open domain Multi-Turn dialogue reasoning
dataset (MuTual) to facilitate conversation model
reasoning capabilities. In particular, given a con-
text, we prepare four response candidates, each of
which is relevant to the context, but only one of
them is logically correct. As shown in Figure 1,
all responses follow the same topic, but only the
first one is appropriated. It requires reasoning abil-
ity on social etiquette and relationship to make the
correct choice, which is not considered by existing
dialogue benchmarks.
We build our dataset based on Chinese high
school English listening comprehension test data,
where students are excepted to select the best an-
swer from three candidate options, given a multi-
turn dialogue and a question. The original data is
formatted as 〈dialogue, question, answer〉, which
is not directly suitable for our goal since chatbots
only concern about how to respond contexts instead
of answering an additional question. Therefore, we
ask human annotators to rewrite the question and
answer candidates as response candidates. Then
our dataset follows the traditional response selec-
tion setting (Lowe et al., 2015), where a model
should recognize a correct response from others for
a multi-turn dialogue.
The resulting dataset, MuTual, consists of 8,860
challenge questions, in terms of almost all ques-
tions involving reasoning, which are designed by
linguist experts and high-quality annotators. We
evaluate state-of-the-art retrieval-based models and
pre-training models on MuTual. The best method
gives a R@1 of 71%, which significantly underper-
forms human performance (94%). To the best of
our knowledge, MuTual is the first human-labeled
reasoning-based dataset for multi-turn dialogue.
We provide detailed analysis to provide insights
into developing potentially reasoning-based chit-
chat dialogue systems.
2 Related work
Table 1 compares our dataset with prior dialogue
and reasoning related benchmarks.
Dialogue: The Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus is a
large retrieval-based dataset (Lowe et al., 2015), ex-
tracted from Ubuntu chat logs. PERSONA-CHAT
(Zhang et al., 2018a) considers consistent person-
ality in dialogue. Crowd workers are required to
act the part of a given provided persona, and chat
naturally. Dialogue NLI (Welleck et al., 2019) is a
natural language inference dataset modified from
PERSONA-CHAT. It demonstrates that NLI can
be used to improve the consistency of dialogue
models. CoQA (Reddy et al., 2019) is collected by
pairing two annotators to chat about a passage in
the form of questions and answers. Each question
is dependent on the conversation history. There are
also several large-scale datasets in Chinese, such as
Sina Weibo (Shang et al., 2015), Douban Conver-
sation Corpus (Wu et al., 2017) and E-commerce
Dialogue Corpus (Zhang et al., 2018b).
As shown in Table 1, most of the existing con-
versation benchmarks do not focus on testing rea-
soning ability. One exception is CoQA, which
considers pragmatic reasoning. The difference is
that CoQA is a machine comprehension dataset, in
which conversations are based on a given passage.
Another related reading comprehension dataset is
DREAM (Sun et al., 2019), which is designed
specifically for challenging dialogue-based reading

comprehension. It relies on an external question
to test the model’s understanding capability. In
contrast to the above dataset, our dataset is a next
utterance prediction task, which is the fundamental
problem in retrieval-based chatbots. In addition,
our dataset requires various specific reasoning abil-
ities, such as algebraic reasoning, intention predic-
tion and so on, which is the main characteristic of
our dataset.
Reasoning: Recently, efforts have been made to
develop benchmarks and tasks to address reason-
ing for language understanding. Winograd Schema
Challenge (Levesque et al., 2012) is a reasoning-
based coreference resolution task. Each pair of sen-
tences differs by only one phrase. SWAG (Zellers
et al., 2018) is derived from pairs of consecutive
video captions, including 113k short context each
with four candidates endings. CommonsenseQA
(Talmor et al., 2019) is a question answering dataset
extracted from CONCEPTNET (Speer et al., 2016).
Utilizing CONCEPTNET to construct the dataset
ensures that questions directly target commonsense
reasoning. RACE is a machine reading compre-
hension dataset collected from English exams for
Chinese students. AI2 Reasoning Challenge (Clark
et al., 2018) contains 7,787 genuine grade-school
level science questions with a corpus of 14M sci-
ence reference sentences. DROP (Dua et al., 2019)
and COSMOS (Huang et al., 2019) focus on factual
understanding and commonsense comprehension,
respectively.
Despite their success, these datasets can hardly
help chatbots directly. Following the traditional dia-
logue response selection setting, we deeply modify
English listening comprehension conversation to
form an utterance prediction task.
3 Dataset
3.1 Collection
The original listening comprehension materials and
question-answer pairs are designed by linguist ex-
perts. Students are required to choose the best
answer from three options for a question based on
a piece of audio. To ensure students fully under-
stand the audio, most of the questions need to be
answered with reasoning capability.
We crawled the listening exams from public web-
sites1. Since the audio is either a conversation be-
tween two people or a simple passage, we only
crawled data in the conversation format. The raw
data is formatted as triples 〈Conversation (audio),
Question and Choices (text), Answer (image)〉. The
following data pre-processing methods are applied
to convert raw data to data in Figure 2.
Step 1 Pre-processing: If question and candi-
date choices in two problems are the same, we
consider them as duplicates and delete one of them.
If there are more than three candidate options in
one problem, we randomly drop incorrect options
until three candidates are left.
The answers are stored as images. We apply a
commercial OCR system to convert images to text.

outputs to ensure quality. In the original listening
comprehension test, the conversation is stored as
audio. We adopt a commercial ASR system to con-
vert speech to text, and further recruit experienced
annotators to correct the transcription errors. To
further ensure the quality of the transcripts, they
are double-checked by annotators in the next step.
Step 2 Candidate Response Creation: Fig-
ure 2 illustrates the process of modifying the listen-
ing comprehension problem. At first, an annotator
is required to segment the original conversation,
after clues to answer the question have appeared.
Then, they construct positive response (Response
A in Figure 2) and negative responses (Response
C and Response D) by consulting correct choice
(Choice A) and incorrect choices (Choice B and
Choice C), respectively. To make MuTual more
challenging, we further ask the annotator to con-
struct one more negative response (Response B)
based on the correct choice. Through these steps,
MuTual not only keeps the reasoning test designed
by experts, but also introduces one more another
type of reasoning for each instance. As shown in
Figure 2, Response C and D can be excluded based
on the relationship between two speakers. But B is
incorrect due to the attitude reasoning.
It is worth noting that all negative responses are
logically correct if the context is not considered, but
they are not appropriated responses if the context is
taken into account. Therefore, our dataset focuses
on multi-turn conversation reasoning rather than
the logic of a sentence. When framing a negative
response, we encourage annotators to copy some
phrases in the context to discourage a model that
can solve the problem by text matching. We fur-
ther calculate the lexical overlap between response
and context. There are 9.98% (10.63%) words in
the positive (negative) response that occur in the
corresponding context, suggesting that MuTual is
hard to solve by plain text matching.
Annotators in Step 2 are all English-major grad-
uate students in Chinese, who are familiar with
English language exams in China and fluent in En-
glish (pass the TEM-82). Annotators are required
to draft annotate 170 instances repeatedly, until
their labeling is sufficiently accurate to provide use-
ful annotation. Because not all conversations are
adapted to construct a reasoning-based response
problem, the annotator has the right to skip the con-

the response, and two quality inspectors to check
it. We discard the instance when inspectors doubt
the uniqueness or correctness of the answer.
3.2 Analysis
The detailed statistics of MuTual are summarized
in Table 2. MuTual has an average of 4.73 turns.
The vocabulary size is 11,343, which is smaller
than other dialogue datasets (Lowe et al., 2015; Wu
et al., 2017). Because MuTual is modified from
listening tests of English as a foreign language, the
complexity of morphology and grammar is much
simpler than other datasets.
For human-annotated datasets, there is always
a trade-off between the number of instances being
annotated and the quality of annotations (Kryciski
et al., 2019). Our dataset is smaller than the previ-
ous crawling-based dialogue dataset (Lowe et al.,
2015; Wu et al., 2017) due to the collection method.
But it is comparable with high-quality reasoning
based dataset (Clark et al., 2018; Khashabi et al.,
2018; Talmor et al., 2019) and human-designed
dialogue dataset (Zhang et al., 2018a). Moreover,
around 10k is sufficient to train a discriminative
model (Nivre et al., 2019) or fine-tuning the pre-
training model (Wang et al., 2019).
To assess the distribution of different reasoning
types, we annotate the specific types of reasoning
that are involved for instance, sampled from the
test set and categorize them into six groups. The
definition and ratio of each group are shown as
follows.
Attitude Reasoning: This type of instance tests
if a model knows the speaker’s attitude towards an
object.
Algebraic Reasoning: This type of instances
tests whether a model is equipped with algebraic
abilities when it chooses a response.
Intention Prediction: This type tests whether a
model can predict what the speaker is going to do
next.

Context Candidates Responses Reasoning Type
Figure 3: Examples from the MuTual dataset. All choices are relevant to context, but only one of them is logic
correct. Some negative choices might be reasonable in extreme cases, but the positive one is the most appropriate.
Clue words are purple and underline.
Situational Reasoning: Situation information
(e.g., Location, Relationship between two speak-
ers) is considered in this type of instance. A model
should mine the implicit information from the pre-
vious context.
Multi-fact Reasoning: In this type of instance,
the correct response is related to multiple facts in
context, which requires the model to deeply under-
stand the context rather than simply text matching.
Others:. There are 9% of instances that require
other commonsense knowledge. For example, at
the bottom of Figure 3, the model should know that
a fully reserved restaurant is usually very popular.
The six types of reasoning are considered the
most relevant to real chatbots. For example, it en-
ables chatbots to make personal recommendations
if a machine knows the user’s attitude. The ability
of intention prediction allows chatbots to respond
more intelligently in a long conversation session.
3.3 MuTualplus
To further increase the difficulty, we use safe re-
sponse to replace one of the candidate responses for
each instance in MuTual. To guarantee diversity,
the safe response is sampled from a list including
“I’m afraid I didn’t quite catch what you were say-
ing.”, “Could you repeat that?”, “I’m really sorry,
I didn’t catch that.”, etc. In particular, once the
instance is chosen, we randomly select a response
to replace. If the positive response is replaced, the
correct one is the safe response. If the negative
response is replaced, the original positive response
is still the best one.
The motivation to build MuTualplus is to evaluate
whether a model is able to select a safe response
when the other candidates are inappropriate. When
we replace the positive response with a safe re-
sponse, it simulates a scenario in which all the
other candidates are incorrect. The phenomenon is
common in retrieval-based chatbots, because lim-
ited candidate responses cannot handle all cases in
practice. Similarly, we can evaluate if the model
can choose the correct response instead of a safe
response when a correct response exists.
4 Experiments
We split the data into training, development and test
sets, with an 80%, 10% and 10% ratio. We pack
instances constructed from the same conversation
during splitting to avoid data leakage. Following
the standard dialogue setting (Lowe et al., 2015;
Wu et al., 2017), we consider our task as a response
selection task and employ traditional information
retrieval evaluation methods, including recall at po-
sition 1 in 4 candidates (R@1), recall at position 2
in 4 candidates (R@2) and Mean Reciprocal Rank
1411
(MRR) (Voorhees, 2000). We compare the perfor-
mance of several response selection models as well
as pre-training models. We simply introduce these
works as follows:
4.1 Baselines
We evaluate individual scoring methods, multi-
choice methods and human performance in our
experiment. Given a context c and four candidates
(r1, r2, r3, r4), the individual scoring method com-
putes a score for each choice independently with
a score g(c, ri), and selects the individual with the
highest score among four candidates. On the con-
trary, the multi-choice method selects the best one
by classification over all choices, formulated as
h(c, r1, r2, r3, r4).
TF-IDF: The correct response tends to share
more words with the context than the incorrect
ones. Following Lowe et al. (2015), we calculate
the TF-IDF vectors for the context and each of the
candidate responses, respectively, and then select
the highest cosine similarity between the context
and the candidate response as the model output.
The “IDF” is calculated only on the training set.
Dual LSTM (Lowe et al., 2015): Two LSTMs
are used to encode context and response, respec-
tively. The relevance between context and response
is calculated by the similarity of the final hidden
state from both LSTMs.
Sequential Matching Network (Wu et al.,
2017): To avoid losing information in the con-
text, SMN constructs a word-word and a sequence-
sequence similarity matrix, instead of utilizing the
last hidden state only, and then aggregates similar-
ity matrix as a matching score.
Deep Attention Matching Network: Zhou
et al. (2018) adopt self attention module (Vaswani
et al., 2017) to encode response and each utterance,
respectively. To match utterance and response,
DAM further applies cross-attention module and
3D matching to obtain final score.
BERT (Devlin et al., 2019): Pre-training models
have shown promising results on various multi-
choice and reasoning tasks (Whang et al., 2019;
Xu et al., 2019). Following Devlin et al. (2019),
we concatenate the context (sentence A), and a
candidate response (sentence B) as BERT input.
On the top of BERT, a fully-connected layer is used
for transforming the [CLS] token representation to
the matching score.
RoBERTa: Liu et al. (2019) re-establish
BERT’s masked language model training objective
by using more data and different hyper-parameters.
We fine-tune RoBERTa in the same way as BERT.
GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019): Given a context,
the positive response has a higher probability com-
pared with negative responses. Motivated by this,
we concatenate context and response as a sequence,
and calculate the joint probability of an entire se-
quence. The response in the lowest perplexity
sequence is considered as the positive response.
Moreover, we fine-tune the GPT-2 on [Context,
Positive Response] pairs in MuTual training set,
denoted as GPT-2-FT.
Multi-choice Method: Inspired by BERT for
multiple choice (Devlin et al., 2019), the task is
considered as picking the most suitable response
by comparing four candidates responses. In partic-
ular, we concatenate each candidate response with
the corresponding context. Each input sequence is
subsequently encoded to produce a [CLS] repre-
sentation. The positive response is predicted based
on the concatenation of all [CLS] representations,
on which a fully connected layer with softmax is
used. The method is denoted as BERT-MC. Sim-
ilarly, we implement RoBERTa-MC as another
multi-choice method.
Human Performance: To obtain the human per-
formance, we employ 3 NLP experts to measure
the ceiling performance on the test set.
4.2 Experiment Results
We report the performance of approaches intro-
duced in 4.1, and human performance. Implemen-
tation details are shown in Appendix B.
4.2.1 Results on MuTual
All models perform significantly worse than on
other popular conversation datasets, such as the
Ubuntu Corpus (Lowe et al., 2015) and the Dia-
logue NLI dataset (Welleck et al., 2019), while
human can address the reasoning problems easily.
For example, BERT gives 85.8 % R10@1 on the
Ubuntu Corpus, but RoBERTa only gives 71.3%
R4@1 on MuTual.
TF-IDF only slightly better than randomly guess-
ing, which indicates that there is no obvious statis-
tic clue between context and positive response. In
contrast, TF-IDF achieves 54.98% R@1 score on
the Ubuntu Corpus, showing our dataset is more
difficult to get the correct answer by text overlap.
We evaluate typical retrieved-based dialogue mod-
els’ performance on MuTual. From Table 3, we

can see that well-designed matching models do not
give better performance compared with simple dual
LSTM, moreover, they drop by more than 50 abso-
lute R@1 points compared to their performance on
the Ubuntu Corpus, indicating that text matching
models cannot handle reasoning problem well.
Both BERT and RoBERTa outperform other
models in MuTual, which is consistent with results
in other literatures (Talmor et al., 2019). This is
mainly because models learn reasoning capability
during the pre-training on a large corpus. Although
RoBERTa only gets 71.3% on R@1, it achieves a
surprising number, 89.2 %, on R@2, indicating that
the model is able to rank the correct response to
the top-2 position. BERT-MC and RoBERTa-MC
obtain similar results with BERT and RoBERTa, re-
spectively. However, even RoBERTa is far behind
human performance 23 points on R@1, indicating
that MuTual is indeed a challenging dataset, which
opens the door for tackling new and complex rea-
soning problems in multi-turn conversations.
GPT-2 and GPT-2-FT also perform undesirably
on MuTual, even if the averaged perplexity on
MuTual testset is 10.40. This phenomenon illus-
trates that 1) sentences in MuTual are fluent; and
2) current generative models still have plenty of
room to improve their reasoning ability.
4.2.2 Results on MuTualplus
As shown in Table 4, all models perform worse
on MuTualplus, indicating the dataset is more dif-
ficult than MuTual, which is consistent with our
assumption. We find that the performance of multi-
choice method is significantly better than individ-
ual scoring method. One possible explanation is
that multi-choice methods consider candidates to-
gether, so they can distinguish whether or not the
safe response is the best one. In contrast, individual
scoring methods are not robust, and safe responses
are easy to confuse methods in the training stage.
Moreover, RoBERTa-MC outperforms others by a
large margin, showing its outstanding performance
on reasoning problems.
Furthermore, we conduct a transfer experiment,
in which models are trained on MuTual but tested
on MuTualplus without fine-tuning. The experi-
ment investigates whether the model handles safe
responses well if they have never seen them in train-
ing corpus. As shown in Table 4, RoBERTa-MC
and RoBERTa drops 24.1% and 6.8%, respectively,

in the transfer setting, demonstrating the benefits
of seeing safe responses during the training pro-
cess. Moreover, the individual scoring RoBERTa
outperforms RoBERTa-MC, showing that the in-
dividual scoring method is more robust, when the
safe response is not fed during training.
4.3 Discussion
Performance across different reasoning types:
To analyze model performance across different
reasoning types, we calculate BERT-MC and
RoBERTa-MC performance on various question
types as we introduce in Section 3.2. As shown
in Figure 4, we find that the trends of BERT-MC
and RoBERTa-MC are similar across different cat-
egories. RoBERTa-MC significantly outperforms
BERT-MC in attitude reasoning and multi-fact rea-
soning. One potential reason is that there are some
normal patterns between action and attitude cap-
tured by RoBERTa-MC, such as “play football” and
“excited”. However, instances that involve algebraic
and situation show poor performance. These two
reasoning types heavily depend on commonsense
reasoning. Taking Figure 5 as examples, it takes
a simple subtraction step to derive the time differ-
ence (5:00 pm - 6h = 11:00 am), but this turns out a
significant challenge for RoBERTa-MC. In the sec-
ond case, RoBERTa-MC fails to infer the dialogue
situation, where the goal is to find a flat to rent.
Performance across different context lengths:
It is interesting that the performance of RoBERTa
does not decrease significantly with the number of
turns increasing, which is different from the phe-
nomenon observed on other datasets. As shown in
Table 5, the performance drops by only 1.9 points
R@1 from 2 turns to long turns (>6), and the per-
formance of 5 turns is higher than those with 4
F: Good morning. What can I do for you? 
M: I am looking for a flat for 2 people near the university. 
F: Well. There are several places available and the rent ranges from 80 to 
$150 a month. What are your requirements?
M: I think of flat for no more than $100 a month is good. I prefer to live in a 
quiet street and I need at least 2 bedrooms.
✘ F: If you have any questions about enrollment, do not hesitate to ask me.
✓ F: How about this flat? If you are satisfied, we can sign the contract 
tomorrow.
F: We have 2 floors in our supermarket.
F: You want only 1 bedroom, so we have three flats that meet your 
requirement.
F: Do you know what time it is right now in New York?
M: Let me see. It’s 5:00 pm now, in New York is 6 hours behind.
F: Let me see, 7 hours behind. It is 11:00 am now in New York. 
F: 5 hours ahead. It is 11:00 pm now in New York.
✘ F: Is it 5:00 pm as well?
✓ F: It is 11:00 am now in New York.

RoBERTa-MC 0.681 0.622 0.609 0.725 0.750
Table 5: Performance comparison (R@1) of different
number of turns on the test set. #T denotes number of
turns. #Instances is the number of instances
turns, indicating the reasoning problems do not
become much harder when the context becomes
longer. The results also show that the difficulty of
MuTual is attributed to reasoning instead of com-
plex conversation history.
Context ablation study: We further verify
whether our dataset requires multi-turn understand-
ing rather than degenerating to a single turn reason-
ing problem. We evaluate Roberta and Roberta-MC
performance when some utterances are manually
removed. Figure 6 shows the performance when
the earliest n utterances are removed in testing. As
the ablation utterance increases, the performance
of RoBERTa and RoBERTa-MC significantly de-
creases, which conforms to intuition. RoBERTa
and RoBERTa-MC achieve only 43.7% and 47.7%
1414
after ablating all utterances in the context, respec-
tively, indicating the importance of each utterance
and the quality of the dataset. Moreover, if we shuf-
fle the sequence of utterance, the performance of
RoBERTa-MC drops by 3.8% only, showing that it
is insensitive to the utterance sequence information.
5 Conclusion
We introduced MuTual, a high-quality manually
annotated multi-turn dialogue reasoning dataset,
which contains 8,860 dialogues and aims to test
reasoning ability of dialogue models. We describe
the process for generating MuTual, and perform
a detailed analysis. We find that various state-of-
the-art models show poor performance in MuTual.
The best model RoBERTa only obtains 71.3% R@1.
There is a large gap between the model perfor-
mance and human performance. We hope that this
dataset facilitates future research on multi-turn con-
versation reasoning problem.
